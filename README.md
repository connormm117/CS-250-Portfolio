# CS-250 Agile and Scrum Portfolio

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains selected work from **CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle** at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  
The course focused on applying **Agile methodology**—specifically the Scrum framework—to real-world software development projects.  
This project demonstrates my ability to collaborate effectively in a Scrum team, adapt to evolving requirements, and deliver high-quality software increments.

## 💡 Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by engaging directly with stakeholders, asking targeted questions, and translating their goals into clear, actionable requirements. **User stories** streamline this process by focusing on *who* needs the feature, *what* they need, and *why* it matters. This ensures the team builds features with a clear understanding of their purpose and value, reducing miscommunication and rework.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I follow an iterative approach to development, delivering functional components early and incorporating feedback at every stage. In my future work, I plan to use Agile processes such as **Sprint Planning** (to set realistic goals), **Daily Scrums** (to maintain alignment), and **Retrospectives** (to identify continuous improvement opportunities). These processes enable adaptability and ensure the end product evolves with the needs of users and stakeholders.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is dependable, communicative, and proactive in both solving problems and preventing them. In Agile teams, this means embracing change, collaborating across disciplines, and sharing accountability for the product’s success. I strive to create a positive, solutions-focused environment where every team member can contribute their best work.
