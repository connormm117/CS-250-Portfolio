Overview
In this journal assignment, you will make a new submission to your portfolio. Remember that you will submit portfolio artifacts in different courses throughout the Computer Science program. This portfolio is an opportunity for you to catalog your learning and showcase your best work to future employers. You will also reflect on the work that you have done in these projects. Reflecting will help add context to refresh your memory when you review your portfolio in the future.

Directions
For this course, submit the Sprint Review and Retrospective deliverable from your final project. This deliverable pulls together the Agile and Scrum practices that you have applied throughout this course.

Once you have submitted this artifact, update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. These prompts are some of the ‚Äúessential questions‚Äù for the Computer Science program. You will encounter these questions in different courses throughout the program. They are open-ended and meant to help you engage with ‚Äúbig ideas‚Äù in the field. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
What to Submit
For your submission, include a link to your repository for your instructor in a text submission. Ensure your repository includes the Sprint Review and Retrospective document that you worked on in this course. You should also include the README file with your written responses. Use the CS Program GitHub Portfolio Tutorial to help you with this submission. This assignment will be graded pass/fail based on completion.

Note: In the previous module, you should have added your instructor as a collaborator. They should have accepted your request. Email your instructor if you have trouble adding them as a collaborator.

## Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
I interpret user needs by actively engaging with stakeholders, asking clarifying questions, and breaking down requests into actionable development tasks. Creating user stories is one of the most effective ways to capture these needs because they focus on the *who*, *what*, and *why* of a feature. User stories make requirements easier to understand for the entire team and ensure that development work is always tied back to delivering value to the user.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development with an iterative mindset, building small, functional increments and gathering feedback as early as possible. In my future work, I plan to continue using Agile processes such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, and Retrospectives. These events keep teams aligned, allow for quick adjustments when priorities shift, and foster continuous improvement throughout the development cycle.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means contributing consistently, communicating clearly, and supporting others when challenges arise. In Agile teams, it also means being adaptable, open to feedback, and willing to collaborate across roles. Good team members share ownership of the project‚Äôs success and help create an environment where everyone can perform at their best.

If you drop this into your GitHub repo before you submit the link to your instructor, your portfolio entry will:

Meet the requirements.

Contain the artifact.

Show a thoughtful reflection in your own words.

Do you want me to also write a short GitHub commit message so it looks neat when you upload the updated README? That way it looks clean and intentional to your instructor.

can we make sure this is something that will impress employers 


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely ‚Äî if we want your README to impress employers, it needs to do more than just meet the school‚Äôs pass/fail requirements.
It should:

Show that you understand Agile concepts and can apply them in real projects.

Use professional, concise language that communicates your skills.

Highlight transferable abilities that employers value (teamwork, adaptability, problem-solving).

Look clean and well-structured in GitHub with clear headings and formatting.

## üí° Reflection

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
I interpret user needs by engaging directly with stakeholders, asking targeted questions, and translating their goals into clear, actionable requirements. **User stories** streamline this process by focusing on *who* needs the feature, *what* they need, and *why* it matters. This ensures the team builds features with a clear understanding of their purpose and value, reducing miscommunication and rework.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I follow an iterative approach to development, delivering functional components early and incorporating feedback at every stage. In my future work, I plan to use Agile processes such as **Sprint Planning** (to set realistic goals), **Daily Scrums** (to maintain alignment), and **Retrospectives** (to identify continuous improvement opportunities). These processes enable adaptability and ensure the end product evolves with the needs of users and stakeholders.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is dependable, communicative, and proactive in both solving problems and preventing them. In Agile teams, this means embracing change, collaborating across disciplines, and sharing accountability for the product‚Äôs success. I strive to create a positive, solutions-focused environment where every team member can contribute their best work.
